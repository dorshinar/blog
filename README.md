# [My Personal Blog](https://dorshinar.me)

In my blog I write articles about things I find interesting. Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

## The Stack

I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) with the [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) which I've customized quite a lot. I'm using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) for CSS-in-JS, and deploying using [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/home) for easy, no configurations needed deploy.

To run locally, simply run `npm i` and then `npm start`, and open <http://localhost:8000.>

## Issues

If you find any issues, I'd love if you could list them on the [issues](https://github.com/dorshinar/blog/issues) page in the repository.

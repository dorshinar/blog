Intro - I bet your all have had a teammate in the past you could not stand. Each with his/her own reasons, maybe you didn't like their professional capabilities, the way their breath smelled in the morning or the inappropriate jokes they made during serious meetings

- Professional capabilities
- Eagerness to learn and evolve
- Personal hygiene
- General attitude

## Learn To Listen

You might be the most experienced developer by a lot on the team. It does not mean you know everything. You can't know everything.

### Everyone Can Teach You Something

I know it's fun to laugh at the newby who suggests a complete refactor on the first day at the job. He obviously does not know the struggles you've been through trying to get the code up and running.

## Incapable Teammates Can Wreak Havoc

No one can be good at everything at once, certainly not when they are inexperienced. But you should always aspire to be the best you can. If you don't, your teammates might feel like you're dragging them down, slowing the team or generally being of little help.

## Product Vision Goes A Long Way

Try to think of our product more than just a bunch of compiled code, served to your customers over HTTP, in the form of a website, an API of a physical appliance. You product is more than that. It should be the carriage that takes your customer from point A to point B, and you should treat that carriage like a Ferrari.

## You Don't Have To Be The Best Developer On The Team

It's OK if you're not the sharpest tool in the shed. There will usually be that one person who's forever in the company, knows every bit of code in the system and can identify problems before you even get a chance to look at the error log.
